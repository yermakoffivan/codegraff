//! The engine's internal event vocabulary (#422 slice 1): one tagged union of
//! every distinct output emission the live streaming path (agent_stream.zig)
//! produces, expressed as semantic content — no ANSI, no pre-rendered text.
//! Frontends never see engine internals: a sink (engine_sink.zig) receives
//! these events and renders them (TUI) or serializes them (--json wire).
//!
//! Growth rules for the vocabulary:
//! - New engine output = a new variant (or a new field on a payload struct),
//!   never a pre-rendered string where structure exists. Rendering choices
//!   (color, spinners, wording of notices) belong to sinks.
//! - `durable` classifies each variant: durable events are the protocol
//!   stream a wire/log sink persists and are what reserve sequence ids;
//!   everything else is a presentation pulse that rides at the current
//!   position. Promoting a pulse to the wire is an externally visible shape
//!   change and is gated behind a schema_version bump (epic #422 rule 1).
//! - Payloads are structs so fields can grow without call-site churn.
