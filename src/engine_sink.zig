//! The EngineSink boundary (#422 slice 1): engine code emits typed events
//! (engine_events.zig) and a sink turns them into a frontend's output — it
//! receives events, nothing else. Two impls:
//!
//! - TuiSink: today's terminal rendering, verbatim. Its helpers live in
//!   frontend territory (agent_stream_render.zig, agent_render.zig via Agent
//!   aliases); slice 1 keeps the render state (thinking_*/md_* fields) on the
//!   Agent it wraps, so the ctx pointer is that state handle. Known slice-1
//!   debt against the strict-sink rule ("sinks render from events only"):
//!   besides that drawing bookkeeping, the reasoning gate still back-reads
//!   Agent policy (show_thinking/sub/stream_quiet — see tuiEmit). A later
//!   slice moves visibility into the event payload or makes it a sink-owned
//!   preference so a transport-split sink needs no reads into the Agent.
//! - JsonSink: the existing --json wire lines for these events,
//!   byte-identical to the old inline emits. The ONE translation point from
//!   internal type to wire shape: any change here is externally visible and
//!   gated behind a schema_version bump. Not yet the ONLY producer of those
//!   shapes, though: subagent_run.zig's guiEmit writes `tool_call`/
//!   `tool_result` rows with an extra `id` (schema_protocol.zig) straight to
//!   stdout, bypassing this sink. Routing them through it needs an optional
//!   `id` on ToolInvocation/ToolOutcome — decide that when #429 takes the
//!   subagent cluster, while these structs are still cheap to change.
//!
//! Events are stamped with a {generation, sequence} Cursor at the dispatch
//! boundary. In --json mode (the only durable sink today), durable events
//! reserve their id INSIDE the same lock that serializes --json stdout,
//! keeping the wire's numbering gap-free and ordered against pool-thread
//! guiEmit writers. NOTE the lock condition is keyed to json_mode, not to
//! vt.durable: an injected durable sink outside --json reserves WITHOUT the
//! lock. When serve/attach (#420) adds one, key the lock to the sink (with a
//! test seam) or it inherits exactly the reorder race this lock prevents.
